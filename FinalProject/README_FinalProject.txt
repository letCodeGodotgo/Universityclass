INSTRUCTION TO RUN
1. Import the code files
2. Click the 'run' button to run them
3. Enter the number to select from menu
3-a1. If select menu 1 and 2, program will ask the location of 'Customer.txt' file
3-a2. Enter the address of 'Customer.txt' file
3-a3. Program display the list from the file and will ask 'What you want to find'
3-a4. Enter product, name, and ID correctly
3-a5. Program will sort the list automatically
3-a6. After sort, program will ask 'What you want to find'
3-a7. Enter product, name, and ID correctly 

DISCRIPTION
a. Sort the context of 'Customer.txt' file with array list with heap sort
a-1. Build the 'HeapSort' code
a-2a. Build the 'ArrayList' code
a-2b. Add 'sort()' method using a-1
a-3a. After the first enter product, name, and ID (3-a4), program display the time which is how long it takes to find.
a-3b.  After the second enter product, name, and ID (3-a7), program display the time which is how long it takes to find.

b. Sort the context of 'Customer.txt' file with linked list with heap sort
b-1a. Buil the 'LinkedList' code
b-1b. Add 'sort()' method using a-1
b-2a. After the first enter product, name, and ID (3-a4), program display the time which is how long it takes to find.
b-2b.  After the second enter product, name, and ID (3-a7), program display the time which is how long it takes to find.

c. 'Customer.txt' file contains 36 sets of product, name and ID by line

d. Sort 2,000 random numbers with BST
d-1a. Generate 2,000 random numbers with program which is 'randNum'
d-1b. Program will create the file, 'Random Number.txt', to store 2,000 random numbers
d-2. Sort random numbers which are in 'Random Number.txt' file with BST
d-3. Calculate maximum depth of the tree
d-4. Calculate the size of the tree with recursive method
d-5. Get 'in-order', 'pre-order', and 'post-order' traversal of the tree
